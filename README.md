# Functional territories of basal ganglia

This repository holds the official release of connectivity maps of functional territories of the basal ganglia. 

The repository contains:
- functional territories of striatum, subthalamic nucleus and thalamus according to their cortical connectivity.
- connectivity parcels of GPi and GPe according to their main subcortical connectional systems (striatopallidal, subthalamopallidal and pallidothalamic pathways)

Connectivity maps here provided have been obtained performing tractography-derived connectivity-based parcellation on 100 unrelated healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project repository and have been registered on the ICBM 2009b Nonlinear asymmetric template. 

A detailed description of the pipeline used to produce the maps is provided in:

Maps of functional territories of basal ganglia are available for download as open resource for future neuroimaging studies; if you use/mention them in your research please cite Bertino et al., 2020.
